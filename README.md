# MeatAxe64

In this repository we coordinate future MeatAxe64 development.

MeatAxe64 is a project to implement the "MeatAxe" for modern
multi-core machines using SIMD and multi-threading. The aim is 
to have collection of fast linear algebra routines for matrices
over finite fields to be used in computational group and modulr
representation theory.

This project was started by Richard Parker and is now maintained by
Jon Thackray.

Currently, there is no code in this repository, but this is soon to be
added.
