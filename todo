Worry about isspace failure (can't detect \n) (still occurs on RH 7.2) ctype is buggered
Worry about return (NULL == s) code generation error
Documentation changes for proj_base, sub_quot
Read memory size from environment
Use memory size from argument parser
Think about better use of grease for ztmu
Make span algorithm generally available
Redo ztrace algorithm not to use row operations
Write span_and_spin for spins on large nullspaces
Profile multiply (eg on 26750 for Co1) for different memory sizes
Profile zns on 3584.e.3 for McL for different memory sizes. Think about grease strategy.
Think about restricting the back echelising in rnf and nsf. Profile zrnf and zrn in best cases
Think about Sn and symmetrized powers
Optimise monst by reversing bit order
Investigate better matrix multiplications
Fix zvp and zps to take less memory
Think about better grease vector selection for making vectors
Find a better algorithm for zsp memory. Investigate performance (1)
Debug emu/zsl file corruption problem (2)
Cleanup return vs exit (1)
Set up performance measurement for differing memory sizes at same grease level (1)
Fix emu to recheck command file immediately if changed (1)
Test stop program (1)
Code quality in commands, mop.c and mmat.c (2)
