Worry about isspace failure (can't detect \n) (still occurs on RH 7.2) ctype is buggered
Worry about return (NULL == s) code generation error
Profile multiply (eg on 26750 for Co1) for different memory sizes
Think about Sn and symmetrized powers
Optimise monst by reversing bit order
Investigate better matrix multiplications
Think about orthogonal group sign
Implement a verbosity level for all programs, with -v <n>. Add a standard parser to deal with this
Debug zsymsq failure on Co2 23 mod 3
Investigate rename failure on large files from zscript
Consider allowing maps into ztsp and ztspf
Analyse unexpected split failure
Document new scripts *
Remove 1 == nor restriction in ztsp *
Fix zvp and zps to take less memory
Think about better grease vector selection for making
Improve zsb{,f} to take multiple generators and extend scripts
Fix zsums use to handle zero elements
Find a better algorithm for zsp memory. Investigate performance (1)
Debug emu/zsl file corruption problem (2)
Cleanup return vs exit (1)
Think about better addition for sparse rows (Test for non-zero on summands?) (1)
Set up performance measurement for differing memory sizes at same grease level (1)
Fix emu to recheck command file immediately if changed (1)
Test stop program (1)
Code quality in commands, mop.c and mmat.c (2)
Examine profiles from monst (1)
Consider a more structured error return type (1)
Convert monster generator to use new operations (2)
Work on lattice of submodules (5)
