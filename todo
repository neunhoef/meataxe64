Worry about isspace failure (can't detect \n) (still occurs on RH 7.2) ctype is buggered
Worry about return (NULL == s) code generation error
Documentation changes for zrand, ztco, ztcv, ztrecover
Documentation changes for sym_basis, proj_base, sub_quot
Think about indicators for non-absolutely irreducible representations
Consider putting memory size into argument parser
Write span_and_spin for spins on large nullspaces
Make zsums and friends distinguish find failure from errors
Fix find_nullity_one and friends to use better codes from zsums and friends
Think about a restricted form of new_irred where we supply the script (only for things like sym_basis)
Profile multiply (eg on 26750 for Co1) for different memory sizes
Profile zns on 3584.e.3 for McL for different memory sizes. Think about grease strategy.
Think about restricting the back echelsiing in rn and ns (and similarly in rnf and nsf)
Think about Sn and symmetrized powers
Optimise monst by reversing bit order
Investigate better matrix multiplications
Think about orthogonal group sign
Look into intermediate file version of find_best_nullity_with_orders and zfln *
Fix zvp and zps to take less memory
Think about better grease vector selection for making vectors
Find a better algorithm for zsp memory. Investigate performance (1)
Debug emu/zsl file corruption problem (2)
Cleanup return vs exit (1)
Think about better addition for sparse rows (Test for non-zero on summands?) (1)
Set up performance measurement for differing memory sizes at same grease level (1)
Fix emu to recheck command file immediately if changed (1)
Test stop program (1)
Code quality in commands, mop.c and mmat.c (2)
Examine profiles from monst (1)
Consider a more structured error return type (1)
Convert monster generator to use new operations (2)
Work on lattice of submodules (5)
