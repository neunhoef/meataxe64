This is relase 2 via github

It has no known bugs.

Installation.

If you're reading this you've checked the source out from github

Before compiling, you probably need to edit m64/src/tuning.h to set
the amount of memory (in megabytes) and the number of threads.
maxchops is probably OK at 25, at least for now.

To use the Intel architecture optimised version do

bash
cd m64/test
source go
makl
compa

For the C generic version (usable eg on an ARM based system) do

bash
cd m64/test
source go
maklc
compc

To check all is well, use the run_all.sh script found in m64/jif

The binaries have names starting "z" and can be found in m64/bin

At present there is no support for running multiple operations in
series, eg to chop up a representation. This will be provided at a
later stage with the addition of the scripts, plus some binaries, from
meataxe 2000.

The fast primes are 2-193, and quadratic and cubic extensions of fast
primes are fast, as are {81,243,16,32,64,128,256,625}

If using the Intel optimised version, the type of machine is tested at
run-time, but megabytes and threads are still compiled in. There is no
ARM specific code at present.
