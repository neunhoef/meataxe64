This is release 3 via github

It has no known bugs.

Installation.

If you're reading this you've checked the source out from github

Before compiling, you probably need to edit m64/src/tuning.h to set
the amount of memory (in megabytes) and the number of threads.
maxchops is probably OK at 25, at least for now.

To use the Intel architecture optimised version do

bash
cd mtx64
make OS=unix ARCH=em64t

For the C generic version (usable eg on an ARM based system) do

bash
cd mtx64
make OS=unix ARCH=generic

For the arm specific version (currently no different from the generic
version but may use NEON in the future) do

bash
cd mtx64
make OS=unix ARCH=arm

To check all is well, use the run_all.sh script found in m64/jif.
You'll need to put the m64 binaries on your path, as described by the
install script

This version supports meataxe64, meataxe2000 and the adaptation layer
to allow meataxe2000 scripts to use meataxe64 binaries.

To install this for the Intel version do

mtx64/install.sh

For the ARM version do

mtx64/install_arm.sh

See the output of the install scripts for how to set up your path.
Meataxe2000 has a documentation page m2000/doc/meataxe.html. There are
also some word documents describing meataxe64. For using the hybrid
system, probably the most important script is split_all, which will
reduce a module to its irreduicble factors, classifying them en route.
A small script count_irreds can be fed the output from split_all to
produce a list of factors and multiplicities. You need the full path
recommended by the install script to use this.

If using the Intel optimised version, the type of machine is tested at
run-time, but megabytes and threads are still compiled in. The other
versions do not have support for specific processor extensions as yet.

All bugs found now belong to me; email me for help, clarification etc.
