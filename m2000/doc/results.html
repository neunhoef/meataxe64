Results from visit of Jon Thackray to RWTH-Aachen June 2002
</h1>
Starting with the agenda
<ul>
<li>
Extending Thackray meataxe to handle condensation - done, at least for
permutation condensation case
</li>
<li>
Extending Thackray meataxe to handle symmetric powers other than skew
- designed but not implemented
</li>
<li>
Detecting when a field extension is required - designed but not
implemented
</li>
<li>
Detecting when a field contraction can be done - essentially already
known
</li>
<li>
Induction of representations - not considered
</li>
<li>
Handling sparse rows and matrices - not considered
</li>
<li>
Solving some hard outstanding problems
<ul>
<li>
Indicator for 196882 for M (estimate 160 days at current technology) -
not considered for time reasons
</li>
<li>
Splitting 196882 for M restricted to B to begin mod 2 table for B -
not considered
</li>
<li>
Similar splits of 196882 restricted to other M groups, eg E, F, F24 -
not considered
</li>
<li>
Indicator for 156538 for Co2 (estimate 100 days at current technology)
- not considered, generation of representation outstanding problem.
</li>
<li>
Further irreducibles for Co1 - 165440 proved irreducible. 218800 and
420256 predicted in permutation representation on 3.Suz.2. Minimal
degree representation containing 218800 found to be 323343, which
would involve a 60Gb subspace file - deferred.
</li>
<li>
Further irreducibles for J4 (we can split 112 * 1220 = 136640) - known
before I left England, 45472 + 89947a+b
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Introducing some Thackray meataxe approaches into Aachen meataxe to
extend its capability - not considered
</li>
<li>
Future meataxing strategy. How should we best make use of expected
CPU, memory, disc advances for the next decade? Some thought applied,
more required
</li>
<li>
Overview of tools/techniques for modular character computations (for
my benefit only) - done
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Other items
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Indicator for 25916 for ON - done
</li>
<li>
New 2-modular representations for HN - 31086 and 34352 plus Galois
conjugates produced and indicators calculated. For irreducibles under
construction.
</li>
<li>
Guidance given to others on completing  Fi22 mod 2.
</li>
<li>
Extension of Thackray meataxe to handle multi (more than 2) generator
algebras.
</li>
<li>
Extension of Thackray meataxe to classify irreducibles when the
generators are singular - more work required.
</li>
<li>
Handling of 64 bit offsets in files added (needed for ON problem and
ongoing HN work).
</li>
<li>
Full first draft documentation produced
</li>
<li>
Added specialised (much more efficient) handling for tensors
</li>
<li>
Indicator calculations made more efficient
</li>
<li>
A talk was given on the results from the new meataxe work
</li>
<li>
Some investigation of numerology for SL(4,5) and Sp(4,5) was
performed, resulting in the discovery of two representations of degree
248 for SL(4,5) with distinct restrictions to Sp(4,5), and two
representations of SL(4,5) of degree 3224 with indicators + and -, one
of which is in the principal block, and the other of which is not.
</li>
</ul>
