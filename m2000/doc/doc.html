Documentation of meataxe programs and scripts
</h1>
<p>
The meataxe consists of a number of programs, and also scripts to
drive them in combination in a higher level fashion. The scripts have
the advantage of automating some processes where efficiency is not the
highest priority, whereas the programs themselves give more fine
grained control where necessary, eg for computations which take many
hours of CPU.
