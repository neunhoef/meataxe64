<a name="Purpose">
<h1>Purpose of the talk</h1>
</a>
<p>
To describe an algorithm suitable for computer implementation for the
computation of the isometry types of quadratic forms, and hence the
group sign for groups preserving such forms. This is of interest for
understanding the embedding structure of arbitrary finite groups
inside classical finite orthogonal groups.
</p>
<a name="Background">
<h1>Theoretical background</h1>
</a>
<p>
The finite analogues of the classical orthogonal groups have long been
known and studied (Dickson). It is well known that in odd dimensions
there is only one isomorphism class of simple orthogonal group, but
for even dimensions there are two classes, distinguished by the size
of a maximal totally singular subspace with respect to the form
(Aschbacher). These classes are labelled plus and minus, with the plus
corresponding to the case of dimension n, and the minus corresponding
to dimension n-1, where the overall dimension is 2n.
</p>
<p>
In the case of dimension 2, there are precisely two isometry classes
of spaces with non-degenerate forms, labelled D+ (hyperbolic) and D-
(definite). In a definite space, there are no non-trivial singular (of
norm zero) vectors. In a hyperbolic space, a basis can be chosen of
two norm zero vectors whose inner product with respect to the
associated bilinear form is non-zero
</p>
<p>
We will assume throughout this talk that all forms are non-degenerate,
ie that the subspace perpendicular to the whole space is {0}. Hence,
given a space V with form f, and a subspace W, we have dim(W) + dim(W
perp) = dim(V). A subspace W will be called totally singular if W
consists entirely of singular vectors and W &lt;= W perp. Clearly then, a
totally singular subspace W of a subspace V of dimension 2n has
dimension at most n. Suppose V has dimension 2n, and W is a totally
singular subspace of dimension less than n-1. Then W perp = U direct
sum W, where dim(U) &gt; 2. Hence U contains a non-zero singular vector
u. Further since U &lt;= W perp, if w is an element of W, then (u+w)f =
uf + wf + (u,w)b, where b is the associated bilinear form, so (u+w)f =
0. Thus W direct sum &lt;u&gt; is a totally singular subspace. Hence we can
grow a totally singular subspace up to its maximum possible size by
adding isotropic elements from its complement in its perp. Clearly
this process stops when either W = W perp, or the complement U is
definite. It is also the case that the termination condition (either
maximum size or definite complement) is independent of the choices of
vectors u that we have made (Witt).
</p>
<a name="Caveats">
<h1>Caveats</h1>
</a>
<p>
The group sign is a property of the actual representation, including
the field over which it exists. Finding a non-zero singular vector is
essentially a matter of solving a quadratic equation over the
representation field, so extending the field quadratically will always
allow the sign to become plus. One can interpret this in terms of
Chevally groups as the embedding of 2Dn(q) in Dn(q**2). Since the
field of the representation is the field of the reduction of the
character, it is easy to deduce which field one should look at, but
nonetheless important to be sure one is looking at the right field.
</p>
<a name="Algorithm">
<h1>The algorithm</h1>
</a>
<p>
The algorithm is a loop. We essentially consider three spaces, V, V
perp and W, where V perp = V direct sum W. The algorithm terminates
when dim(W) = 2, at which point the isometry type of W is the answer.
Initially, V = {0}, and V perp and W are therefore the whole space. We
actually hold only a basis for W, which we enumerate w1, w2, ...wm.
Each iteration consists of the following steps, assuming m &gt;= 3 (note
that m is always even).
</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Find a vector w != 0 within &lt;w1, w2, w3&gt; such that wf = 0. Thus w
extends V by one dimension to V'.</li>
<li>Discard one of the vectors w1, w2, w3 from the basis of W, the
choice having non-zero coefficient in the expression of w. Thus we
have W' such that V' direct sum W' = V perp. Let w1', ... wk' be the
basis of W' so derived, where k = m-1.</li>
<li>Compute the bra (w, )b (a vector by matrix multiplication).</li>
<li>Now compute ui = (w,wi')b for each wi'.</li>
<li>Choose i such that ui != 0 (such i must exist because dim(V' perp)
= dim(V perp) - 1).</li>
<li>For each j != i such that uj != 0, subtract uj * (ui inverse) *
wi' from wj'.</li>
<li>Discard wi' from the basis of W', giving a basis of W'' such that
V' perp = V' direct sum W''.</li>
<li>dim(W'') = dim(W) - 2, and V', V' perp and W'' satisfy the entry
conditions for the loop. If dim(W'') &gt; 2, start again at step 1.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Finally, given W such that dim(W) = 2, we attempt to find a non-zero
isotropic vecvtor. If we succeed, the answer is plus (W'' is
hyperbolic). If not, the answer is minus (W'' is definite).

<a name="Results">
<h1>Some results</h1>
</a>
<p>
I have computed the orthogonal group signs for characteristics 2, 3, 5
for HS and McL (groups for which I have some sentimental attachment).
I am not prejudiced against larger primes, however, my meataxe
currently does not support any field sizes larger than 5.
