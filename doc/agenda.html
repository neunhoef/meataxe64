<h1>
Agenda for visit of Jon Thackray to RWTH-Aachen June 2002
</h1>
<h2>
Proposed by Jon Thackray. In no particular order
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Extending Thackray meataxe to handle condensation
</li>
<li>
Extending Thackray meataxe to handle symmetric powers other than skew
</li>
<li>
Detecting when a field extension is required
</li>
<li>
Detecting when a field contraction can be done
</li>
<li>
Induction of representations
</li>
<li>
Handling sparse rows and matrices
</li>
<li>
Solving some hard outstanding problems
<ul>
<li>
Indicator for 196882 for M (estimate 160 days at current technology)
</li>
<li>
Splitting 196882 for M restricted to B to begin mod 2 table for B
</li>
<li>
Similar splits of 196882 restricted to other M groups, eg E, F, F24
</li>
<li>
Indicator for 156538 for Co2 (estimate 100 days at current technology)
</li>
<li>
Further irreducibles for Co1
</li>
<li>
Further irreducibles for J4 (we can split 112 * 1220 = 136640)
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Introducing some Thackray meataxe approaches into Aachen meataxe to
extend its capability
</li>
<li>
Future meataxing strategy. How should we best make use of expected
CPU, memory, disc advances for the next decade?
</li>
<li>
Overview of tools/techniques for modular character computations (for
my benefit only)
</li>
</ul>
