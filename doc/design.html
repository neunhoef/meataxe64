Design decision during construction of meataxe

<ul>
<li>
Maintain external printed form as per sources on Birmingham website.
In particular, header is a two digit nod (number of digits), followed
by three six digit fields, the prime power, nor (number of rows) and
noc (number of columns). nod determines how many digits will be
consumed per matrix entry. Matrices are printed at a maximum of 80
characters per line.
</li>
<li>
Internally, all matrices are held as arrays of unsigned ints. Field
values are packed into these, with the least significant bits
corresponding to lower column numbers. Some wastage may occur at word
boundaries, if the prime power does not require a number of bits which
is a power of two (eg 5 or 7).
</li>
<li>
Binary matrices are held in essentially the same as form as
internally, except that they are always little endian. Endian
conversion takes place on input and output. This allows different
endian machines, eg Sparcs and PCs, to use the same binary format
whilst achieving internal efficiency. Each binary matrix contains a
four word header, consisting of nob (number of bytes), prime power,
nor, noc.
</li>
<li>
-1 is represented as p-1, and indeed all elements of GF(p) are
represented as their integer minimal non-negative coset
representatives.
