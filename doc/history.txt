20010825 - Started
20010828 - first working ip for GF2
20010830 - first pr and ad for GF2
20010902 - first mu for GF2
20010904 - first grease for GF2
20010905 - first input for GF3
20010906 - first add for GF3
20010908 - first successful multiply for GF3
20010909 - first input and add mod 5
20010909 - first multiply mod 5
20010910 - first input, print, add and multiply for GF4
20010912 - cleaning up, introduced len, started on memory.h Knocked .3 sec off B multiply
20010913 - Made mul work row by row on matrix 2. Imported monster generator and cleaned it up
20010914 - More clean up, tested monster generation
20010916 - Added names to all programs, wrote memory handling and added it to all but mul
20010918 - Discovered B GF2 multiplication goes much faster in less memory (caching issues)
20010918 - Same for M, best was about 400k memory
20010918 - Redid all of mu and grease in terms of new memory strategy
20010918 - Added row incrementers and shaved more time off
20010919 - Started on grease for other primes and word overlapping elements
20010919 - Grease going for all available primes, but only one d for p > 2
20010924 - Removed return values from rows ops. Changed len to be in words
20010925 - Cut headers down to prime, nor, noc, in that order
20010925 - First cut at conversion of emu and slave
20010926 - First emu running single machine
20010927 - Better modularisation of makefile
20010930 - First successful monster multiply on element A (the involution)
20010930 - Move some junk out of ead and emu into utils, system, files
20011001 - Abstract out map creation and extended row output
20011002 - Created eid and used to complete check on A*A, Created zex
20011003 - Add goals, update design. Fix funny lock files. Finish work on getin. Sort exrows. Add memory to slave
20010905 - Remove static linking. Remove -lm and -lmcheck.
20010905 - Remove some optimisation unavailable on RedHat 4.2
20011006 - Write eim and ct/ect. Start on part 2 on b**3 = 1 demonstration
20011007 - Test eim. Write tr and etr. Test tr. Rewrite slave and test
