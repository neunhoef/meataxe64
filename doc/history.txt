20010914 - More clean up, tested monster generation
20010916 - Added names to all programs, wrote memory handling and added it to all but mul
20010918 - Discovered B GF2 multiplication goes much faster in less memory (caching issues)
20010918 - Same for M, best was about 400k memory
20010918 - Redid all of mu and grease in terms of new memory strategy
20010918 - Added row incrementers and shaved more time off
20010919 - Started on grease for other primes and word overlapping elements
20010919 - Grease going for all available primes, but only one d for p > 2
20010924 - Removed return values from rows ops. Changed len to be in words
20010925 - Cut headers down to prime, nor, noc, in that order
20010925 - First cut at conversion of emu and slave
20010926 - First emu running single machine
20010927 - Better modularisation of makefile
20010930 - First successful monster multiply on element A (the involution)
20010930 - Move some junk out of ead and emu into utils, system, files
20011001 - Abstract out map creation and extended row output
20011002 - Created eid and used to complete check on A*A, Created zex
20011003 - Add goals, update design. Fix funny lock files. Finish work on getin. Sort exrows. Add memory to slave
20010905 - Remove static linking. Remove -lm and -lmcheck.
20010905 - Remove some optimisation unavailable on RedHat 4.2
20011006 - Write eim and ct/ect. Start on part 2 on b**3 = 1 demonstration
20011007 - Test eim. Write tr and etr. Test tr. Rewrite slave and test
20011008 - Write stop.c to introduce kill commands into the command file
20011010 - Fix bug introduced into emu. Minor improvments to mmat
20011010 - Add id subroutine
20011011 - More improvements to mmat and mop.c
20011013 - Yet more monster generation work
20011016 - Wrote input permutation
20011019 - Wrote exploded input permutation
20011105 - Moved prime detection into prime.c
20011106 - Added invert and negate for 2, 3, 4, 5, and for element sets
20011107 - Added first version of clean and echelise
20011112 - First in store rn
20011112 - rn can operate without grease
20011113 - matrix_malloc can't fail. Debugging rn. Add proper row_incer and in place scale
20011115 - produced simple rank
20011116 - rn works. sns produced
20011118 - ns produced
20011119 - Produced mul_from_store
20011120 - Started on in store spin
20011121 - Complete first attempt at spin
20011122 - Debug spin to work with B
20011124 - Subspace splits He 2058 permutation representation
20011125 - Started on quotient space
20011125 - quotient space works
20011128 - wrote split script and reduced He2058
20011130 - wrote te, reduced He8330 and started on He29155
20011201 - wrote file based ss and signature
20011202 - wrote file based qs
20011204 - wrote zwords for producing words in a representation
20011210 - improved power, better memory split in ss
