Max,

To test the installation, apart from running Richard's tests, you can
try the following:-

Substitue where you installed stuff for my test_install below. Unzip
and untar the McL file. We can now demonstrate the splitting of the
skew fourth power of the 2 modular irreducible 22 for McL, which is
what I did in my PhD. It should take a couple of minutes, and both
invocations of split_all should produce the same output. But, because
this is the first time anyone other than me has tried this, I expect
there will be bugs instead.

export PATH=~/test_install/m2000:$PATH
cd ~/groups/McL/GF2
split_all compound/McL compound/7315_{1,2}
export PATH=/home/jon/test_install//pinstall:/home/jon/test_install//ptinstall/jif:$PATH
cd ../GF2.m64/
export PATH=/home/jon/test_install//pinstall:/home/jon/test_install//ptinstall/jif:$PATH
